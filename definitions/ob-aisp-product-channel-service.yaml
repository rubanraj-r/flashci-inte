                    The methodology of how credit interest is charged. It can
                    be:-


                    1. Banded

                    Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole
                    balance as balance increases.


                    2. Tiered

                    Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each
                    tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed
                    for that tier and not on whole balance.


                    3. Whole

                    The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the PCA
                    balance

                        description: >-
                          The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is
                          calculated under the assumption that any interest paid
                          is combined with the original balance and the next
                          interest payment will be based on the slightly higher
                          account balance. Overall, this means that interest can
                          be compounded several times in a year depending on the
                          number of times that interest payments are made.

              have common needs and respond similarly to a marketing action.
              Market segmentation enables companies to target different

                    Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole
                    balance as balance increases.


                    2. Tiered

                    Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each
                    tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed
                    for that tier and not on whole balance.


                    3. Whole

                    The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the BCA
                    balance

                        description: >-
                          The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is
                          calculated under the assumption that any interest paid
                          is combined with the original balance and the next
                          interest payment will be based on the slightly higher
                          account balance. Overall, this means that interest can
                          be compounded several times in a year depending on the
                          number of times that interest payments are made.

                    'Whole'  Where the same charge/rate is applied to the
                    entirety of the overdraft balance (where charges are
                    applicable).

                    'Tiered' Where different charges/rates are applied dependent
                    on overdraft maximum and minimum balance amount tiers
                    defined by the lending financial organisation

                    'Banded' Where different charges/rates are applied dependent
                    on overdraft maximum and minimum balance amount bands
                    defined by a government organisation.

                Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance
                as balance increases.


                2. Tiered

                Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as
                balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier
                and not on whole balance.


                3. Whole

                The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the BSA
                balance

                    description: >-
                      The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is
                      calculated under the assumption that any interest paid is
                      combined with the original balance and the next interest
                      payment will be based on the slightly higher account
                      balance. Overall, this means that interest can be
                      compounded several times in a year depending on the number
                      of times that interest payments are made.

                1. Banded

                Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance
                as balance increases.


                2. Tiered

                Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as
                balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier
                and not on whole balance.


                3. Whole

                The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the PSA
                balance

                      The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is
                      calculated under the assumption that any interest paid is
                      combined with the original balance and the next interest
                      payment will be based on the slightly higher account
                      balance. Overall, this means that interest can be
                      compounded several times in a year depending on the number
                      of times that interest payments are made.
